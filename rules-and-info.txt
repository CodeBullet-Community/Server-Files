[help rules banner]

**1. Google your question before asking.** Most answers can be found on Google
	**-** You can ask for help understanding code you find via Google
**2. Do not post large blocks of code.** Instead, you can either:
	**-** Post a link to a Pastebin (or similar) of the code
	**-** Upload the code to Discord in a file
	**-** Only include the code required to solve the problem
**3. You may only ping helpers if nobody has responded to your question for 15 minutes**
**4. Do not ask for other people to write code for you** (aka don't be a help vampire)
	**-** Do not ask others to do homework for you
	**-** (Asking for ideas or troubleshooting is fine.)
**5. Clearly indicate when you're working with code you didn't write**
	**-** Do not pretend code someone else wrote is yours. We will know

*Helpful commands:*
	- `?h2a` tells you what you need to post when asking for help
	- `?a2a` for telling people that they should ask not ask to ask
	- `?format` gives the syntax for Discord's syntax highlighting
	- `?google` and `?google2` give you the solutions to most of your questions

[Consequences banner]

**Consequence Escalation Levels** (CEL)
	**1.** Warning
	**2.** Temporary mute
	**3.** Permanent ban
When enforcing the rules Moderators will follow the CEL, however, depending on the situation they may start at any level. 
Members should only get warned if the Moderators aren’t sure if that member is aware of the rule 
or once (but only once) with the bot if the incident isn’t very significant. 
Users who join our Discord server only to violate the rules will be immediately permabanned.

[join staff banner]

If you are active in this community and want to contribute to it more then just talking and speaking you can try to join the staff.
To make the process of finding staff easier for us we created a google form where you can provide us with some information.
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKK6d5Nch1pBMrCxvsgGbfG0S3GM6BUk-DhLNkunKCOPBm8Q/viewform>

Whenever we start looking for new staff members our choice will be primarily based on your behavior in the community and 
the provided information in the form will be used if we can't decide or if we want to cover certain times.
There is also the possibility that we will ask if you want to join the staff without you having filled out the application.
