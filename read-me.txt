**Welcome to Code Bullet and Co!!**
This server belongs to @Code Bullet#6516 and his **Youtube channel** (link below).
Its main purpose is to talk about programming and AI related topics, but it is also used for general conversation.
Before you ask any questions please first check out #faq.
As a member of this server, you are **obligated to follow the rules**.

[rules banner]

**1. Don't be toxic/a d*ck**:
    *- Example:* calling people names and suggesting them to do things to themselves that may cause harm to themselves (even in jest)
    *- Example:* calling out peoples work as stupid and such. There are less offensive ways to tell somebody you disagree with their suggestion or comment
**2. Don't talk off topic in a chat**:
    *- Example:* talking about coding in #discord-suggestions or pokemon in #neural-networks chat
**3. Don't spam**:
    *- Example:* using excessively foul language
    *- Example:* posting of images/gifs excessively in chats not meant for primarily images/gifs
    *- Example:* line spamming (typing using excessive lines/messages)
**4. Respect moderators**:
    *- Example:* If a moderator asks you to take an argument/discussion elsewhere, take it elsewhere
**5. Don't @ people/roles for no reason or a reason too minor** (including mods)
**6. Only self-promote in #self-promotion** (also don't self-promote your self-promotion, that's just dumb)
**7. Only speak English**
**8. No NSFW content**
**9. Comply with Discords ToS** (found at <https://discordapp.com/terms>)
**10. No trading or advertising a trade that involves money transactions on this server**
**11. No blank names**
**12. No files that can directly be executed and which can affect a PC** (If the file first needs to be modified to be executable, for example changing the ending of a EXE file, it is allowed)
**13. No impersonation using the same/similar name/nickname** except with permission
*Note:* 
	- what you say can be used against you (if you talk about breaking a rule and not getting punished for it, that can be used to punish you)
	- moderators can use their own discretion
	- super admins are considered admins
