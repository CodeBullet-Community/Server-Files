# Server-Files

This repo hosts all files for the CB discord server. This includes Rules, FAQ and banner images.
Mod Rules isn't here because it contains confidential information.

## Stats

Contains manually created statistics about the server and a very simple extractor for extracting role count from Dyno's output. The extractor is more of a bodge then a actual proper extractor.

## Emojis

Contains all emojis added by Codec.

## Banners

Contains the banners used in #read-me-first and #self-assign. You'll have to to install the Norwester font if you want to edit or view the `banner.xcf` file. The christmas banners aren't complete, because when we used them we didn't have the missing banners yet.
