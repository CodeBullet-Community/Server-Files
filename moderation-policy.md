# Moderation Policy

## Rule Violation Consequences

### **C**onsequence **E**scalation **L**evels (CEL)

1. Warning
2. Temporary mute
3. Temporary Ban
4. Permanent Ban

When enforcing the rules Moderators will follow the CEL, however, depending on the situation they may start at any level. Members should only get warned if the Moderators arenâ€™t sure if that member is aware of the rule or once (but only once) with the bot if the incident isnâ€™t very significant. Users who join our Discord server only to violate the rules will be immediately permabanned.

## Moderator Etiquette

1. Moderators should always be calm and polite, even when users are not.
2. Moderators should never be rude to users.
3. Moderators should not use their power based on their personal opinion, penalties should be based on moderation policies.
4. Moderators should try to inform users when they remove their content or mute them.
5. Moderators should offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.

## Second Chance System

- If a user gets banned and requests a second chance, we will consider It. The final decision will be made with a majority vote where mods and admins can vote.
- User can only request a second chance after they spend 1 Month banned(as a permanent ban)
- In case a user gets a second chance, they will be under the following rule: \
  `If they break a rule during the first month they will get a permanent ban. For that period the only possible punishment will be a ban.` \
  After the first month, the rule gets removed from them and they will be treated as a normal member again. Meaning, they will get punished according to the situation and past rule violations. No Moderation Logs will be removed from the record after the 1 month.
- While voting if the user violated a rule during the first month, the question should always be `Did the user violate a rule?` not `Should we ban this user because he violated a rule?`, because this would mean we treat it like a normal punishment.
- Everyone only gets ONE second chance. If they get banned a second time, they'll be banned forever, period.

## Voting System

- Minimum Voting Time: `1 hour`
- Maximum Voting Time: `48 hours`
  - For changes in server rules or policies: `1 Week`
- Minimum Votes: `60% of Staff`
  - No opinion is considered a vote

## Server Suggestion System

Server suggestions with more than 10 votes (excluding bot reactions) should always be discussed by the staff. While and after discussing the suggestion it will be marked with the following reactions by the staff:

| Emoji | Meaning                |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| ðŸŸ     | Discussing             |
| ðŸŸ¢    | Suggestion approved    |
| ðŸ”´    | Suggestion denied      |
| ðŸ”µ    | Suggestion implemented |

Incase someone suggests something that is already implemented it will be also marked with ðŸ”µ.
When approving a suggestion it will first be marked with ðŸŸ¢ and then when it has been implemented additionally with ðŸ”µ.
