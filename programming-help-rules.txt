[Programming Rules Banner]

Rules for programming help channels:

**0. All rules of the server apply. Read them in #read-me-first right now.
1. Google your question before asking. Most answers can be found on Google.**
  - *You can ask for help understanding code you find via Google.*
**2. Do not post large blocks of code. Instead you can either:**
  - *Post a link to a pastebin (or similar) of the code.*
  - *Upload the code to Discord.*
**3. You may only ping helpers if nobody has responded to your question for 15 minutes.
4. Do not ask for other people to write code for you.**
  - *Do not ask others to do homework for you.*
  - *(Asking for ideas or troubleshooting is fine.)*
**5. Clearly indicate when you're working with code you didn't write.**
  - *Do not pretend code someone else wrote is yours. We will know.*

Helpful commands:
  *- ?h2a tells you what you need to post when asking for help
  - ?format gives the syntax for Discord's syntax highlighting
  - ?google and ?google2 give you the solutions to most of your questions*
