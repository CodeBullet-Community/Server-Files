[welcome banner]

**Welcome to Code Bullet and Co!!**
This server belongs to @Code Bullet#6516 and his **Youtube channel** (link below).
Its main purpose is to talk about programming and AI related topics, but it is also used for general conversation.
Before you ask any questions please first check out #faq.
As a member of this server, you are **obligated to follow the rules**.

[rules banner]

**1. Prohibited Behavior**
	**a.** Insulting (Outside of obvious sarcasm, joking, playing around)
	**b.** Defamatory - Spreading fake information to damage one’s reputation
	**c.** Sexism, Racism, Homophobia, Community Discrimination
	**d.** Doxxing - Releasing someone’s private information to other members without consent
	**e.** Unauthorized impersonation
	**f.** Talking off-topic in the channels
**2. Prohibited Content**
	**a.** NSFW Content
	**b.** Directly Executable Files
	**c.** Non-English Conversations
	**d.** Advertisement outside of #self-promotion
		**-** *No monetary advertisements*
**3. No Spamming**
	**a.** Sending messages with arbitrary characters in a fast sequence
	**b.** Sending the same message again and again in a fast sequence
	**c.** Repeatedly mentioning roles or members
	**d.** A sequence of one-word or very short messages
**4. Prohibited Naming**

	**b.** Names prohibited by rules in sections 1 and 2
**5. Follow the Discord ToS**
	**a.** <https://discordapp.com/terms>
	**b.** Age restriction of 13 years will be enforced

*Note:* 
	- What you say can be used against you (if you talk about breaking a rule and not getting punished for it, that can be used to punish you)
	- Moderators can use their own discretion
	- Super admins have the same authority as admins
	- Rule violations are on a person not user basis. So an alt won't erase past violations

[help rules banner]

**1. Google your question before asking.** Most answers can be found on Google
	**-** You can ask for help understanding code you find via Google
**2. Do not post large blocks of code.** Instead, you can either:
	**-** Post a link to a Pastebin (or similar) of the code
	**-** Upload the code to Discord in a file
	**-** Only include the code required to solve the problem
**3. You may only ping helpers if nobody has responded to your question for 15 minutes**
**4. Do not ask for other people to write code for you** (aka don't be a help vampire)
	**-** Do not ask others to do homework for you
	**-** (Asking for ideas or troubleshooting is fine.)
**5. Clearly indicate when you're working with code you didn't write**
	**-** Do not pretend code someone else wrote is yours. We will know

*Helpful commands:*
	- `?h2a` tells you what you need to post when asking for help
	- `?a2a` for telling people that they should ask not ask to ask
	- `?format` gives the syntax for Discord's syntax highlighting
	- `?google` and `?google2` give you the solutions to most of your questions

[Consequences banner]

**Consequence Escalation Levels** (CEL)
	**1.** Warning
	**2.** Temporary mute
	**3.** Temporary Ban
	**4.** Permanent  Ban
When enforcing the rules Moderators will follow the CEL, however, depending on the situation they may start at any level. 
Members should only get warned if the Moderators aren’t sure if that member is aware of the rule 
or once (but only once) with the bot if the incident isn’t very significant. 
Users who join our Discord server only to violate the rules will be immediately permabanned.

[join staff banner]

If you are active in this community and want to contribute to it more then just talking and speaking you can try to join the staff.
To make the process of finding staff easier for us we created a google form where you can provide us with some information.
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKK6d5Nch1pBMrCxvsgGbfG0S3GM6BUk-DhLNkunKCOPBm8Q/viewform>

Whenever we start looking for new staff members our choice will be primarily based on your behavior in the community and 
the provided information in the form will be used if we can't decide or if we want to cover certain times.
There is also the possibility that we will ask if you want to join the staff without you having filled out the application.
